# Overview
- This code provides a set of utility functions for working with Nx, a framework for building scalable applications with Angular, React, and other frontend frameworks.
- The main functionalities include:
  - Updating the TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.base.json) to include path aliases and remove unwanted options.
  - Removing the `workspaces` field from the `package.json` file.
  - Adding a new script to the `package.json` file.
  - Deleting files and directories from the file system.
  - Updating the `package.json` file by removing unwanted scripts, dependencies, and other configurations.
  - Utility functions for working with Prisma, a database toolkit, such as reading the Prisma schema, mapping Prisma types to NestJS types, and parsing the Prisma schema to extract model information.
  - Functions for generating template files and managing dependencies and devDependencies in the `package.json` file.

# Functions/Classes
## `updateTypeScriptConfig(tree: Tree)`
- Updates the `tsconfig.base.json` file to set the `baseUrl` for path aliases and remove the `emitDeclarationOnly` option if it exists.

## `removeWorkspacesFromPackageJson(tree: Tree)`
- Removes the `workspaces` field from the `package.json` file.

## `addScriptToPackageJson(tree: Tree, scriptName: string, scriptCommand: string)`
- Adds a new script to the `package.json` file.

## `addToModules(options: AddToModulesOptions)`
- Adds a module to a module array in a file, including adding the import statement if it doesn't exist.

## `deleteFiles(tree: Tree, filesToDelete: string[])`
- Deletes the specified files from the file system.

## `deleteDirectory(tree: Tree, dirPath: string)`
- Recursively deletes the specified directory and all its contents from the file system.

## `endsWithQuestionMark(str)`
- Checks if a string ends with a question mark.

## `removeQuestionMarkAtEnd(str)`
- Removes a trailing question mark from a string.

## `getPrismaSchemaPath(tree)`
- Retrieves the path to the Prisma schema file from the `package.json` file.

## `readPrismaSchema(tree, prismaPath)`
- Reads the Prisma schema content from the specified path, which can be a file or a directory containing multiple schema files.

## `mapPrismaTypeToNestJsType(prismaType: string)`
- Maps Prisma data types to their corresponding NestJS types.

## `parsePrismaSchema(schemaContent: string, modelName: string)`
- Parses the Prisma schema and extracts information about a specific model, including its fields and their types.

## `getNpmScope(tree: Tree)`
- Retrieves the NPM scope from the `package.json` file.

## `generateTemplateFiles(options: GenerateTemplateOptions)`
- Generates template files based on the provided options, including the Prisma schema, library root, template path, and NPM scope.

## `isPackageInstalled(tree: Tree, packageName: string)`
- Checks if a package is already installed in the `package.json` file.

## `installPlugins(tree: Tree, dependencies: Record<string, string>, devDependencies: Record<string, string>, options: { configureProjectGraph?: boolean, pluginNames?: string[] })`
- Installs the specified dependencies and devDependencies in the `package.json` file and configures the Nx project graph plugins when appropriate.

## `updateTsConfigPaths(tree: Tree, importPath: string, libraryRoot: string)`
- Updates the `tsconfig.base.json` file to include a new library path.

## `updateTypeScriptConfigs(tree: Tree, libraryRoot: string)`
- Updates the `tsconfig.json` files in the Nx workspace to include a reference to the specified library root.

## `getAllPrismaModels(tree: Tree)`
- Retrieves information about all Prisma models, including their fields, primary field, and CRUD auth configuration.

## `parseCrudAuth(comment: string)`
- Parses the CRUD auth configuration from the Prisma model documentation.
