# Overview
This code is a generator function that sets up a NestJS-based API project with various dependencies and configurations. The generator performs the following tasks:

1. Adds necessary dependencies to the `package.json` file.
2. Updates the `tsconfig.base.json` file to set the `baseUrl` for path aliases and remove the `emitDeclarationOnly` option if it exists.
3. Updates the `package.json` file to:
   - Initialize the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` array if it doesn't exist.
   - Add required packages to the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` array.
   - Add a `generate:models` script to generate GraphQL models.
4. Removes the `workspaces` section from the `package.json` file if it exists.
5. Runs `pnpm install` after the generator completes.

# Functions/Classes
## `updateTypeScriptConfig(tree: Tree)`
- This function updates the `tsconfig.base.json` file in the project.
- It sets the `baseUrl` for path aliases and removes the `emitDeclarationOnly` option if it exists.
- The updated configuration is then written back to the file.

## `updatePackageJson(tree: Tree)`
- This function updates the `package.json` file in the project.
- It initializes the `pnpm` section and the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` array if they don't exist.
- It adds a list of required packages to the `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` array if they don't already exist.
- It adds a `generate:models` script to the `scripts` section.
- The updated `package.json` file is then written back to the file.

## `removeWorkspacesFromPackageJson(tree: Tree)`
- This function removes the `workspaces` section from the `package.json` file if it exists.

## `apiSetupGenerator(tree: Tree): Promise<GeneratorCallback>`
- This is the main generator function that orchestrates the entire setup process.
- It calls the `addDependenciesToPackageJson` function to add the necessary dependencies to the `package.json` file.
- It calls the `updateTypeScriptConfig`, `updatePackageJson`, and `removeWorkspacesFromPackageJson` functions to update the respective configuration files.
- Finally, it returns a callback function that will run `pnpm install` after the generator completes.

# Behavior Flow
1. The `apiSetupGenerator` function is called with a `Tree` object, which represents the file system of the project.
2. The function adds the necessary dependencies to the `package.json` file using the `addDependenciesToPackageJson` function.
3. The `updateTypeScriptConfig` function is called to update the `tsconfig.base.json` file.
4. The `updatePackageJson` function is called to update the `package.json` file with the `pnpm` settings and the `generate:models` script.
5. The `removeWorkspacesFromPackageJson` function is called to remove the `workspaces` section from the `package.json` file if it exists.
6. The generator function returns a callback that will run `pnpm install` after the generator completes.

# Key Points
- This generator is designed to set up a NestJS-based API project with various dependencies and configurations.
- It ensures that the necessary TypeScript and package.json configurations are in place for the project to function correctly.
- The generator relies on the `@nx/devkit` library to perform file system operations and update configuration files.
- The `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` array is used to specify the packages that should be built from source, which can improve build performance.
- The `generate:models` script is added to the `package.json` file to provide a convenient way to generate GraphQL models.
- The removal of the `workspaces` section from the `package.json` file is necessary to ensure compatibility with the `pnpm` package manager.
