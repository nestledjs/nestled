# Overview
This code is a setup script that ensures the necessary environment and dependencies are in place for a project. It performs the following key tasks:

- Loads environment variables from a `.env` file
- Checks if the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set and if it points to a local database
- Ensures that Docker is running and that the necessary Docker Compose services are up and running
- Runs Prisma setup commands to generate the Prisma client and schema
- Generates GraphQL types from the Prisma schema
- Runs Prisma seed scripts to populate the database with initial data

The script is designed to be run during the project setup process to ensure a consistent and reliable development environment.

# Functions/Classes
The code imports several helper functions from the `./lib/helpers` module:

- `canConnect(DATABASE_URL)`: Checks if the application can connect to the database at the specified `DATABASE_URL`.
- `ensureDockerIsRunning()`: Ensures that the Docker daemon is running.
- `ensureDockerComposeIsRunning()`: Ensures that the required Docker Compose services are running.
- `ensureDotEnv()`: Ensures that a `.env` file exists in the project directory.
- `log(message)`: Logs a message to the console.
- `runPrismaSetup()`: Runs the Prisma setup commands to generate the Prisma client and schema.
- `runGraphQLTypeGeneration()`: Generates GraphQL types from the Prisma schema.
- `runPrismaSeed()`: Runs the Prisma seed scripts to populate the database with initial data.

The main function exported by the script is an asynchronous function that orchestrates the setup process.

# Behavior Flow
1. The script loads the environment variables from the `.env` file.
2. It checks if the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set and if it points to a local database. If not, it throws an error.
3. The script then checks if the application can connect to the database at the specified `DATABASE_URL`. If not, it ensures that Docker is running and that the necessary Docker Compose services are up and running.
4. The script then runs the Prisma setup commands to generate the Prisma client and schema.
5. After a 2-second delay, the script generates the GraphQL types from the Prisma schema.
6. Finally, the script runs the Prisma seed scripts to populate the database with initial data.

# Key Points
- The script relies on several environment variables, particularly `DATABASE_URL`, to configure the development environment.
- It ensures that the necessary Docker and Docker Compose services are running before proceeding with the setup.
- The script uses Prisma to manage the database schema and seed data, and to generate GraphQL types.
- The script includes error handling to provide informative error messages if any of the setup steps fail.
